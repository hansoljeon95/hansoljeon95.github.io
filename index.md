## About

Here is my [curriculum vitae](https://hansoljeon95.github.io/cv.html) (to be updated).

## Romanization
This blog uses [Yale romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_romanization_of_Korean) with the following modification:
- 'ㅸ' is transcribed by 'v'.
- 'ㅇ /ɣ or ɦ/' is transcribed by 'g'.
- Vowels are not abbreviated.
    - 'ㅗ, ㅛ' is always transcribed as 'wo, ywo'.
    - Modern '무, 부, 푸' are always romanized into 'mwu, pwu, phwu' respectively.
- Pitches are indicated with diacritics.
    - Low : grave accent (à)
    - High : acute accent (á)
    - Rising : caron (ǎ)
- Pitches determined by pitch assignment rules are not marked. (e.g. *twúlwumi* "crane")
- Low pitches are not marked, except in the following cases:
    - Pitch marks from cited texts.
    - Pitches that are consistently realized as low. (e.g. *kálcòlò* "handle of a knife")
    - When the underlying form consist solely of low pitches. In this case, only the last syllable will be marked. (e.g., *tolì* "bridge")
    - Cases where ambiguity may arise.
